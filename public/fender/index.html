    The Fender Precision Bass (often shortened to "P-Bass") 
    is a model of electric bass guitar manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. 
    In its standard, post-1957 configuration, the Precision Bass is a solid body, 
    four-stringed instrument usually equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup
     and a one-piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.
     Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951. 
     It was the first electric bass guitar to earn widespread attention and use, 
     remaining among the best-selling and most-imitated electric bass guitars 
     with considerable effect on the sound of popular music.
